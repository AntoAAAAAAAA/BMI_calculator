st.text('Building this app was another step in my journey to turn my coding skills into something real, something that people could actually use. I started this project shortly after completing my Texas Public Health Disparities Dashboard, and while that project focused heavily on data analysis and visualization, this one gave me the chance to shift gears and create an interactive tool with real-time user input.')
st.text('This project helped strengthen my confidence with Streamlit and introduced me to features I had not worked with much before, like multipage design, dropdown menus, and session state management. It also gave me a welcome creative break from the data science–focused projects I had tackled recently. I genuinely enjoyed building this.')
st.text('That said, it came with its challenges. I had to figure out how to structure the multipage system, get the BMI logic right, and troubleshoot how Streamlit stores or wipes user data across tabs. I also used AI throughout the process — not to solve problems for me, but to help me think through them. It was especially useful for organizing the BMI calculation logic and building out a Spanish translation system. Making the app accessible in both English and Spanish was important to me, and AI helped me approach that goal more effectively.')
st.text('By the time it all came together, I was really excited. This is easily the most polished and visually clean app I have built so far. It felt good to finish something I could be proud of, even though things got stressful near the end. One issue I still have not solved is how user inputs are cleared when navigating between pages. From everything I have read, it is a limitation in how Streamlit handles state, and even after hours of troubleshooting, I could not fully work around it.')
st.text('Still, this project taught me a lot about coding, persistence, and creating tools with a purpose. I am proud of it and excited to keep learning.')
